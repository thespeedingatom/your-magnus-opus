Software development sits uncomfortably between engineering and art. We borrow language from construction—architecture, building, foundations—but the metaphor breaks down under scrutiny.

## Beyond Engineering

Buildings don't change after construction. Software never stops changing. Buildings have clear completion criteria. Software is never truly finished.

The craft metaphor serves better. Like woodworking or ceramics, software development requires:

- Deep knowledge of materials (languages, frameworks)
- Understanding of tools and their appropriate use
- Sensitivity to context and user needs
- Continuous refinement of technique
- Acceptance that mastery is asymptotic

## Qualities of Craft

What distinguishes craftwork from industrial production?

**Intentionality**: Every decision is made consciously. Defaults are questioned. Shortcuts are weighed against their costs.

**Care**: The craftsperson takes pride in work that may never be seen. Internal quality matches external quality.

**Iteration**: Work improves through repeated cycles of creation and reflection. Each project informs the next.

**Personal voice**: While respecting conventions, the craftsperson develops a recognizable approach. Style emerges from accumulated decisions.

## Practical Application

Treating code as craft means:

```
// Not just working code, but considered code
// Not just features shipped, but problems understood
// Not just tickets closed, but users served
```

It means caring about naming things well. Structuring code for the reader who comes next. Writing documentation that teaches rather than merely documents.

## The Cost

Craft takes time. In environments optimized for speed, craft feels like luxury. But the cost of not caring accumulates—technical debt, brittle systems, burned-out teams.

The craft approach asks: what are we building, and why does it deserve care?

Sometimes the answer is: it doesn't, ship it fast.

Often the answer is: this matters, do it well.

Knowing the difference is itself a craft.

## Why Write?

Writing clarifies thinking. The act of putting thoughts into words—coherent, sequential words—forces a rigor that internal monologue never demands.

When I write, I discover what I actually believe. The fuzzy intuitions sharpen. The contradictions surface. The gaps become visible.

## What to Expect

This space will hold explorations of:

- **Design**: Systems, typography, interfaces, and the principles that make them work
- **Technology**: Tools, practices, and their implications for how we work and live
- **Craft**: The pursuit of quality in creative and technical work

No promises of consistency. No commitment to a schedule. Just thinking, refined through writing, shared in case it resonates.

## The Format

I've chosen a minimal approach. No comments—if you want to respond, find me elsewhere. No analytics—I'd rather not know. No newsletter—if this matters to you, you'll return.

Just words on a page, designed with care, offered freely.

Let's begin.
